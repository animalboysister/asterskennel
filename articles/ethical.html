                    <h1>is zoosexuality ethical? responses to common anti-zoo arguments</h1>
                    <div class="text">
                      <p>I was sixteen when I first told my boyfriend how I felt. It was a warm summer's evening; I was away on holidays at the time, preparing the text message I was about to send. My heart raced as I tried to find the words. We had talked about many related things before, but I knew what I was about to say wasn't something that most people would ever admit. “sometimes”, I wrote “I think I love animals in the same way I do humans”.</p>
                      <p>Thankfully, he confessed that he felt the same way. Despite having such feelings since I first became sexually aware, I think that was the first time I ever described myself as a zoophile. Having a label for how I felt finally allowed me to accept and explore it. But, with that acceptance comes a question: could practising something like this ever be ethical?</p>
                      <p>Zoophilia or zoosexuality is the romantic or sexual attraction to non-human animals. While topics such as LGBTQ+ rights, polyamory, and kink communities have increasingly found spaces for open discussion, zoosexuality remains  relegated to whispers, shame, and outright condemnation. Yet, for all its moral complexity, it raises profound questions about ethics, human nature, and our responsibilities to the non-human creatures we share the world with.</p>
                      <p>Obviously, as animals lovers we don't want to harm those we care so deeply about. Yet, due to the stigma of the attraction, all you'll find is arguments against practising zoosexuality, and not necessarily because they're true. Often it's the same arguments that have been lazily regurgitated time and time again without a single critical thought.</p>
                      <p>But of course it's important that we consider these arguments, to ensure that we act in a way that is indeed ethical. So, in this article I've decided to take the time to dismantle these common arguments against zoosexuality for zoos and anti-zoos alike to get a better idea of why practising our sexuality can be perfectly healthy and valid.</p>
